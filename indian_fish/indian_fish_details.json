        "Step 2: Straining and Preparing the Broth: Strain the broth, reserving the liquid. Pick any desirable fish flesh from the bones and set aside. Reserve the cooked carrots and bell pepper, dicing them into small cubes for later use.",

Slowly drizzle two ladles of hot soup into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to temper. Pour the tempered mixture into the soup, stirring gently. Remove from heat immediately. Add the reserved fish pieces and diced vegetables.",

Once cool enough to handle, squeeze roasted garlic into a small bowl. Add a pinch of salt and slowly whisk in the vegetable oil. Add about 1/2 cup of cold water and mix well.
