      "ingredients": [
        "1 cup raw cashews",

        "Step 1: Ensure your mixer is completely dry and free of any moisture. Grind the cashews into a fine powder.",
        "Step 2: Lightly grease a flat plate or tray and a rolling pin with ghee. Set aside.",
        "Step 3: In a thick, wide-bottomed pan (preferably non-stick), combine the sugar and water. Mix well until the sugar dissolves completely.",
        "Step 4: Place the pan over medium heat and bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Continue to cook the syrup, monitoring it closely.",
        "Step 5: To check the consistency of the syrup, perform a thread test.  Drop a small amount of syrup into a bowl of cold water. It should form a soft, pliable thread that doesn't dissolve immediately. The desired consistency for Kaju Katli is just before the single-thread consistency.",
        "Step 6: Once the syrup reaches the correct consistency, reduce the heat to low and add the cashew powder. Mix vigorously to ensure there are no lumps. Continue to stir for 2-3 minutes.",
        "Step 7: The mixture will start to thicken and come together. It should be non-sticky and form a soft, pliable ball when you take a small portion and roll it between your fingers.",
        "Step 8: Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool for about 5 minutes.",
        "Step 9: Transfer the mixture to the greased plate. Using the greased rolling pin, roll it evenly to a thickness of about 1/4 inch.",
        "Step 10: Cut the rolled dough into diamond shapes. Allow to set and harden slightly before storing in an airtight container."
