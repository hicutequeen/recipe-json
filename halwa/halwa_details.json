      "ingredients": [
        "90 grams mamra almonds (or \u00bd cup)",
        "1 cup boiling water, for soaking and blanching",
        "\u2153 cup water, for blending",
        "\u215b teaspoon saffron strands",
        "70 grams ghee (clarified butter) (or \u00bd cup)",
        "100 grams sugar (or \u00bd cup)"
      ],
      "directions": [
        "Step 1: Rinse the almonds 1-2 times in water. Soak them in a bowl of boiling hot water, cover, and blanch for 30-45 minutes. Alternatively, soak the almonds overnight in water.",
        "Step 2: Soak the saffron strands in warm or hot water.",
        "Step 3: Drain the almonds and peel off the skins. They should come off easily after blanching.",
        "Step 4: Add the blanched and peeled almonds to a grinder or blender.",
        "Step 5: Add \u2153 cup of water and grind or blend the almonds to a fine, semolina-like consistency. Grind in parts or use the pulse option, scraping down the sides as needed to ensure even grinding.",
        "Step 6: Heat a thick-bottomed pan over low heat. Transfer the almond paste to the pan, scraping the sides and bottom of the jar to get all of the paste.",
        "Step 7: Cook the almond paste for 2-3 minutes, stirring continuously, until fragrant.",
        "Step 8: Add the sugar and stir well to combine evenly with the almond paste.",
        "Step 9: Continue stirring and cook over low heat for 5-6 minutes, until the sugar melts and the mixture thickens.",
        "Step 10: Add the saffron solution and mix well.",
        "Step 11: Add the ghee in batches, starting with 2 tablespoons. Stir and cook until the ghee is absorbed by the halwa mixture.",
        "Step 12: Repeat Step 11 until all the ghee is incorporated. Continue cooking and stirring over low heat.",
        "Step 13: After adding all the ghee, stir continuously until the halwa thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan. You should see small holes forming in the halwa as you stir.",
        "Step 14: Continue cooking and stirring until the halwa lumps together around itself and pulls away from the sides of the pan. This should take about 10 minutes after adding the ghee.  To test, take a tiny portion (be careful, it's hot), let it cool slightly, and roll it into a ball. It should form a smooth, soft ball and not be sticky or wet.",
        "Step 15: Once done, switch off the flame and transfer the halwa to a container to set. Alternatively, you can spread it on butter paper, fold it, and serve once cooled.",
        "Step 16: Serve badam halwa warm or at room temperature. It stays good for 1-2 days at room temperature or can be refrigerated."
