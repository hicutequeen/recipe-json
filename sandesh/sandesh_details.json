      "ingredients": [
        "1 liter full cream milk",
        "1.5 tablespoons lemon juice",
        "1/8 cup powdered sugar (heaped)",
        "1 tablespoon pistachios, powdered coarsely (for garnishing)",
        "A few strands of saffron"
      ],
      "directions": [
        "Step 1: Bring the full cream milk to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat.",
        "Step 2: Once the milk begins to boil, add the lemon juice and stir gently. The milk will start to curdle, separating the curds from the whey. Continue stirring to prevent burning at the bottom until the whey has completely separated. Then, turn off the heat.",
        "Step 3: Collect the curds (paneer) and transfer them to a muslin cloth. Tie the cloth securely and hang it for at least 30 minutes to drain any remaining whey.",
        "Step 4: Once drained, rinse the paneer under cool water to remove the sour lemon flavor. Squeeze out any excess water.",
        "Step 5: In a mixing bowl, combine the paneer and powdered sugar. Use a food processor to grind this mixture into a smooth paste. Although the recipe suggests kneading, grinding results in a finer texture.",
        "Step 6: Transfer the smooth mixture to a nonstick pan (tawa) and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes. Initially, the mixture will be sticky, but will gradually become non-sticky.",
        "Step 7: As the mixture starts to turn non-sticky, add the saffron strands and mix well. When the saffron is absorbed and the mixture has a creamy texture, turn off the heat.",
        "Step 8: Let the mixture cool slightly; this is called \"Makha,\" which is the unformed Sandesh. While still warm, shape small balls and flatten them slightly with your palms.",
        "Step 9: Make a small indentation in the center of each piece and garnish with powdered pistachios. The Sandesh will firm up as it cools."
