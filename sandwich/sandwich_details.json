Incorporate the soft butter and increase the speed to high for a few seconds until well combined. Lower the speed back to medium and knead for an additional 10 minutes until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and is elastic.",

Stir in the spinach and cook for a few minutes until wilted. Remove from heat and mix in the ricotta cheese until combined.",
        "12. To assemble the burgers, slice the buns in half and lightly warm them in the oven. Spread a layer of Lautrec pink garlic cream on the bottom half of each bun, then use a round cookie cutter to place about 1 to 1.5 cm thick layer of duck confit on top. Top with spinach and drizzle additional garlic cream before serving."

Knead for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces and shape each piece into a ball. Then, create a hole in the center of each ball and enlarge it to about 5 cm in diameter. Place the bagels on a lightly floured surface, cover with a cloth, and let rise for about 2 hours until they double in size. After rising, preheat the oven to 220\u00b0C. Boil 3 liters of water with salt, brown sugar, and potato starch. Poach each bagel for 1 minute on one side and 30 seconds on the other side. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a clean towel to absorb excess moisture. Place them on an oiled baking sheet, brush with beaten egg, sprinkle with pine nuts, and bake for 15 minutes.",

Meanwhile, prepare the marinade by mixing mustard, olive oil, lemon juice, sugar, a pinch of salt, and a pinch of pepper in a small bowl. Once cooked, place the tofu on a paper towel to absorb excess oil. Arrange the tofu in a shallow plate and pour the marinade over it. Cover and refrigerate for 30 to 60 minutes.",
        "2. While the tofu marinates, prepare the toppings. Boil the eggs in a pot of water for 10 minutes, then slice and set aside. Rinse the lettuce and tomato, and slice the tomato. Thinly slice the shallot. In a small bowl, mix the mayonnaise and ketchup together. Toast the bread slices.",
        "3. Take the first slice of toasted bread and spread with the ketchup-mayonnaise mixture. Place a square of marinated tofu on top, followed by a layer of tomato slices and then the sliced egg. Top with another slice of toasted bread, spreading the ketchup-mayonnaise mixture on this slice before placing it down.",
        "4. Repeat the layering: Spread another layer of ketchup-mayonnaise on the new slice of bread, add another square of tofu, sprinkle with shallots, and then cover with the lettuce leaves.",
        "5. Finish by spreading ketchup-mayonnaise on the final slice of bread, place it on top, and cut the sandwich diagonally into triangles."

Monitor their cooking; they should become lightly golden but not burnt. When the first side has colored, flip them over and continue cooking until both sides are cooked through and the batbouts puff up slightly. Allow to cool at room temperature.",

In a mixing bowl or food processor, combine 250 grams of flour, yeast, and sugar. Add the cooled liquid mixture, beaten eggs, and olive oil. Mix for 8 minutes, gradually incorporating the remaining flour, two tablespoons at a time, until the dough is elastic.",

On a floured surface, divide the dough into eight equal pieces, shape them into balls, and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Allow to proof for an additional 30 minutes.",

Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 180\u00b0C (350\u00b0F) and bake for another 10 minutes. Once baked, allow to cool before slicing in half.",

        "7. Prepare the parmesan white sauce: Melt 50 grams of butter in a saucepan, then whisk in 50 grams of flour until smooth. Gradually add the milk, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens. Stir in the grated parmesan and season with salt.",
        "8. Assemble the burgers: Spread mustard on the bottom half of each bun. Layer on a leaf of bok choy, a veggie patty, parmesan sauce, cheddar cheese, onion rings, and slices of tomato. Optionally, add pickles. Spread ketchup on the top half of the bun and microwave the assembled burger for 30 seconds to 1 minute until heated through. Enjoy!"

Layer the ham evenly over the buttered sides of the bread. On one third of each slice, add a layer of the cheese mixture. Roll the bread tightly starting from the cheese side. Wrap each roll in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.",

Melt a little unsalted butter and brush it over the sides and tops of the croque-makis. Grill in an oven preheated to 200\u00b0C (about 390\u00b0F) for approximately 5 minutes, or until golden brown.",

Divide the salmon tartare into 4 portions and shape them into firm patties. Place each salmon patty on the warmed bed of coarse Gu\u00e9rande sea salt in the preheated oven and bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Check for doneness by observing the inside of the patties without flipping them.",

Slice the beef heart tomato into thick slices. Open each burger bun and place them in the oven, cut side down, for 5 minutes to toast them. Assemble your burgers with the prepared ingredients.",

You can serve them fresh after letting them sit for an hour, or bake them covered with coarse Gu\u00e9rande sea salt in the preheated oven at 150\u00b0C (302\u00b0F) for 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Make a well in the center and add the water, the milk-yeast mixture, and the egg. Mix and knead the dough at medium speed until it pulls away from the bowl. Add the softened butter and knead for an additional 5 minutes. Shape the dough into a ball and let it rise for 1 hour in a warm, draft-free place covered with a damp cloth, or for 30 minutes at 35 degrees Celsius.",
        "2. On a floured work surface, punch down the dough. Divide it into 6 equal pieces (approximately 110 grams each). Flatten each piece into a rectangular shape about 1 cm thick. Fold the top third over, then fold again to create small baguette shapes, sealing the edges tightly with your fingers. Place the shaped dough on a baking sheet, allowing enough space between them. Let them rise for an additional 30 minutes in a warm, draft-free place. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Brush the buns with a little milk and optionally sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds. Bake for about 15 minutes, monitoring towards the end to avoid burning. The buns should be lightly golden. Allow to cool on a wire rack.",
        "3. Prepare the homemade ketchup: In a saucepan, combine all ketchup ingredients. Stir well and simmer for about 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken. Allow to cool.",
        "4. Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the sausages according to package instructions.",
        "5. Assemble the hot dogs: Slice the buns open, spread some ketchup inside, add a leaf of lettuce, two tomato slices, a piece of cheddar, the sausage, and a drizzle of ketchup. Optionally, warm in the microwave or oven to melt the cheese and heat the buns before serving.",
        "6. Note: This recipe is highly customizable based on personal preference. Feel free to add mustard, onions, or even sauerkraut!"
