Mix well and marinate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, in the refrigerator.",
        "Step 2: Prepare the Rice: Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in fresh water for 30 minutes.",
        "Step 3: Fry the Onions: Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan over medium-low heat. Add the sliced onions and fry, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crispy. This should take about 20 minutes. Remove the fried onions with a slotted spoon and set aside. Reserve the oil in the pan.",
        "Step 4: Parboil the Rice: In a large pot, bring 8 cups of water to a boil. Add the cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, cloves, bay leaves, and star anise. Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the rice is about 60% cooked (slightly firm to the bite). Drain the rice and set aside.",

Add the marinated chicken and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the oil separates from the mixture. Transfer the cooked chicken to a separate bowl.",
        "Step 6: Layer and Cook the Biryani: In the same pan, spread a thin layer of the cooked chicken mixture. Top with a layer of the parboiled rice, followed by a sprinkle of the fried onions. Repeat the layering process until all the chicken, rice, and fried onions are used. If desired, mix the yellow food coloring with the milk and drizzle over the top layer of rice.",

Place a heavy object, such as a bowl filled with hot water, on top of the lid to create a seal. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 15 minutes, or until steam escapes from under the lid.",
        "Step 8: Rest and Serve: Remove the pan from the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes. Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving. Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) and hard-boiled eggs."
