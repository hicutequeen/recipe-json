        "In a mixing bowl take \u00bc cup fresh curd or yogurt. For a vegan naan, use almond or cashew yogurt.",
        "Add 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1 pinch baking soda.",
        "Mix all the ingredients very well till the sugar dissolves.",
        "Now add 2 cups all-purpose flour (maida), 1 teaspoon salt or add as required.",
        "Mix again with a spoon so that the salt is evenly distributed in the flour.",
        "Make a well in the center and add 2 tablespoons oil. Note that you can even add butter instead of oil.",
        "Add \u00bc to \u2153 cup water or add as required.",
        "First mix and then begin to knead.",
        "Knead to a smooth and soft dough. If the curd is thick, then you may need to add some more water. In case the dough looks dry, then add some more water and knead. If it becomes sticky, then sprinkle some flour and knead again. You should get a soft stretchy dough.",
        "Flatten the dough and spread some oil all over the dough. Place in the same bowl.",
        "Place a moist kitchen towel or napkin completely covering on the dough. Cover the bowl with a lid and let the dough leaven for 2 hours.",
        "Make medium-sized balls from the dough.",
        "Flatten slightly and sprinkle some flour on the dough as well as on the rolling board.",
        "Sprinkle some onion seeds or sesame seeds (black or white) or melon seeds on the rolled dough.",
        "Roll into a 6 to 7 inches elongated circle.",
        "Roll the top side to get a tapering edge. You can even gently pull the dough with your hands to get this pointed edge. The naan will have a tear-shaped form.",
        "Heat a skillet or tawa or griddle and keep it on medium-high to high flame. Place the naan bread ready on the hot tawa or skillet or griddle.",
        "Keep the flame to medium-high or high and begin to cook the naan bread.",
        "Let one side get partly cooked. You will see some air pockets on the naan.",
        "When you start seeing the air-pockets, then flip.",
        "Now cook the second side on medium-high to high flame.",
        "Again you will see air-pockets appearing on the second side.",
        "Flip when you see many air-pockets on the naan and place naan directly on the stovetop flame.",
        "Grill the first side on the flame till you see some charred spots and blisters.",
        "Also, roast the edges.",
        "Turn over and roast the second side too till you see some charred spots.",
        "Place it on a plate or tray. Spread or brush with some softened butter or melted butter. You can even use ghee (clarified butter or oil for a vegan version. You can even skip using butter or oil entirely.",
        "Heat the griddle or skillet on a high flame. Place the naan on the hot griddle or tawa.",
        "You will see some air pockets on the naan.",
        "Flip the naan bread.",
        "Cook the second side more than the first side. Please note that on a high flame they will get cooked faster.",
        "Press the edges with a spatula so that they are also roasted and cooked properly.",
        "Flip again.",
        "You can flip again and press the edges for even cooking. Remove and spread some butter or oil. Serve hot. This way make naan with any of the methods. You can even stack cooked naans in a casserole box or roti basket and serve later.",
        "Serve the naan bread hot or warm with your favorite curry dish \u2013 malai kofta or palak paneer or matar paneer or lentils like dal tadka or dal makhani or chole masala or rajma masala or dal bukhara.",
