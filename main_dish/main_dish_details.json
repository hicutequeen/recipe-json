        "Step 2: Brining the Turkey: Early on the day of cooking or the night before, combine the chilled brine and ice water in a clean 5-gallon bucket or container. Place the thawed turkey breast-side down in the brine. Ensure the turkey is fully submerged. Cover and refrigerate or store in a cool area (around 40\u00b0F) for 6 hours.

Insert a probe thermometer into the thickest part of the breast. Return the turkey to the oven and reduce the temperature to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).

Incorporate a linen napkin and a scattering of breadcrumbs for a touch of casual elegance.",

Add the grated Brussels sprouts and stir well. Cover and cook over low heat until the sprouts are softened, about 5-7 minutes. Garnish with coriander leaves.",
        "Step 4: Prepare the dough: In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and a pinch of salt. Add the cooked Brussels sprouts mixture to the flour. Mix well. The moisture from the sprouts should be enough to form a dough. If needed, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until a soft dough forms. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the dough and knead for a minute. Cover and let it rest for 5 minutes.",

Flip and cook the other side until golden brown spots appear. Brush with oil on the second side as well. Cook until both sides are golden brown and cooked through.",

Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then add cumin seeds, curry leaves, urad dal, and chana dal. Fry until light brown.",
        "Step 2: Saut\u00e9 Aromatics and Spices: Add chopped onions and saut\u00e9 until softened. Stir in ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, and salt. Saut\u00e9 until fragrant. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they break down slightly.",

        "Step 5: Prepare the Dough: In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and a pinch of salt. Add the cooled carrot and pea mixture. Mix well to form a dough. Add a little water if needed, but the moisture from the vegetables should be sufficient. Cover the dough and let it rest for 5 minutes.",
        "Step 6: Roll and Cook the Parathas: Divide the dough into small equal-sized balls. Roll each ball into a thin circle (about 6 inches in diameter) on a lightly floured surface.  Heat a flat griddle or tawa over medium heat.",
        "Step 7: Cook the Parathas: Place a rolled paratha on the hot tawa. Cook for about a minute, or until small bubbles start to appear. Flip the paratha and drizzle a little oil on the cooked side.  Flip again when the other side has brown spots and cook until golden brown on both sides. Repeat with the remaining dough balls.",
        "Step 8: Serve: Serve the hot carrot and green pea parathas with yogurt or chutney."
