        "Step 1: Cook the rice: In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Add the rinsed brown rice, swirl to coat, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18-25 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. Drain any excess water if necessary.",
        "Step 2: Prepare the sushi vinegar: While the rice is cooking, combine the rice wine vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Transfer to a jar or dish and cool in the refrigerator.",
        "Step 3: Season the rice: Once the rice is cooked, remove from heat and add the cooled vinegar mixture. Gently stir with a rubber spatula or fork to avoid overmixing. The rice will appear wet initially but will dry as it cools.",

        "Step 8: Slice and serve: Using a sharp, serrated knife, slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces. Serve immediately with pickled ginger, tamari or soy sauce, and wasabi. Leftovers can be stored covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."

        "Step 1: Cook the Rice: In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Add the rinsed brown rice, swirl to coat, and reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 18-25 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. Drain any excess water if necessary.",
        "Step 2: Prepare the Sushi Vinegar: While the rice is cooking, combine the rice wine vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan. Heat over medium, stirring occasionally, until the sugar and salt dissolve. Transfer to a jar or dish and cool in the refrigerator.",
        "Step 3: Season the Rice: Once the rice is cooked, remove from heat and gently fold in the cooled vinegar mixture using a rubber spatula or fork. Avoid overmixing. The rice will appear wet initially but will dry as it cools.",
        "Step 4: Prepare the Vegetables: While the rice cooks and cools, thinly slice the bell pepper, carrots, and cucumber. Ensure the vegetables are thinly sliced for easier rolling.",
        "Step 5: Assemble the Sushi Rolls: Place a sheet of nori on a sushi mat. Wet your hands to prevent sticking and spread a thin, even layer of rice over the nori. Leave a small space at the top edge.",
        "Step 6: Add Fillings: Arrange a generous portion of the sliced vegetables and alfalfa sprouts in a line across the rice about 1 inch from the bottom edge closest to you.",
        "Step 7: Roll the Sushi: Using the sushi mat, lift the bottom edge of the nori over the filling and begin rolling tightly, tucking in the filling as you roll. Moisten the top edge of the nori with water to seal the roll. Repeat with remaining nori and fillings.",
        "Step 8: Slice and Serve: Using a sharp, wet knife, slice each sushi roll into 6-8 equal pieces. Serve immediately with pickled ginger, tamari or soy sauce, and wasabi. Leftovers can be stored covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."
