        "Step 1: Prepare the spinach. If using frozen spinach, place it in a ceramic plate and microwave for 2 minutes until slightly softened. Alternatively, heat in a nonstick pan for 5 minutes. If using fresh spinach, wash and chop it finely, boil for 10 minutes in a little water, then cool to room temperature and grind to a semi-solid state.",
        "Step 2: Prepare the vegetables. If using frozen mixed vegetables, microwave according to package instructions for 2-3 minutes. For fresh vegetables, chop the carrot and cauliflower. Heat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a pan, add the chopped vegetables, fry for 1 minute, and cover the pan to cook for an additional 2 minutes.",
        "Step 3: Temper the spices. In a nonstick pan, heat 2 teaspoons of oil over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and asafoetida, and when the seeds begin to pop, add the chopped onions, ginger, and garlic. Fry until the onions turn golden brown while adding a pinch of salt to expedite cooking.",
        "Step 4: Add the spices. Mix in red chili powder and coriander powder, and cook until the raw smell dissipates.",
        "Step 5: Incorporate the vegetables. If using frozen butter vegetables, add them and cook for 5 minutes. If using fresh vegetables, add them and cook for 5 minutes. Then, mix in the prepared spinach puree and season with salt. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes until the vegetables are thoroughly cooked.",
        "Step 6: Combine the spinach and yogurt. Once the vegetables are cooked, stir in the chopped spinach from Step 1 and cook for a few more minutes. Then, reduce the heat and add the whisked yogurt, mixing well. Cook for another 2 minutes.",
        "Step 7: Serve the curry hot with rice, chapati, or paratha. Enjoy this unique Indo-German dish!"
