        "Step 1: Prepare the Pulao Masala: In a small dry grinder or coffee grinder, combine the cumin seeds, caraway seeds (if using), fennel seeds (if using), black cardamom seeds (if using), green cardamom seeds (if removing from pods), cloves, cinnamon, mace, and stone flower (if using). Grind to a fine powder. Set aside.",
        "Step 2: Prepare the Rice: Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in enough water for 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.",
        "Step 3: Prepare the Aromatics and Paneer: Thinly slice the onion. Chop the mint leaves. Crush the ginger, garlic, and green chili into a paste using a mortar and pestle. Cut the paneer into cubes.",
        "Step 4: Saut\u00e9 the Onions and Spices: Heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil in a large pot or pan over medium heat. Add the bay leaf and saut\u00e9 for a few seconds. Add the sliced onions and saut\u00e9 until golden brown or caramelized.",
        "Step 5: Add Ginger-Garlic Paste and Spices: Add the ginger-garlic-chili paste and saut\u00e9 until the raw aroma dissipates (about 10-15 seconds). Stir in the chopped mint leaves and the ground pulao masala. Saut\u00e9 for 5-8 seconds.",
        "Step 6: Add Peas (Optional) and Rice: If using peas (or other vegetables), add them to the pot and saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes. Add the drained rice and stir gently. Saut\u00e9 for 1 minute.",
        "Step 7: Cook the Rice: Add 3 to 3 1/4 cups of water, lemon juice (if using), and salt to the pot. Stir well. Cover the pot tightly with a lid and simmer over low to medium heat until the rice is cooked through and the water is absorbed. Add more water if needed.",
        "Step 8: Pan-Fry the Paneer: While the rice is cooking, heat 2-3 teaspoons of ghee or oil in a separate non-stick pan or tawa over medium heat. Add the paneer cubes and pan-fry until light golden brown. Do not overfry. Set aside.",
        "Step 9: Combine Paneer and Rice: Once the rice is cooked, turn off the heat and let it rest for 5 minutes. Gently mix in the pan-fried paneer cubes. Cover the pot again and let it sit for another 5 minutes to allow the paneer to absorb the flavors of the pulao.",
        "Step 10: Serve: Serve the paneer pulao hot or warm, garnished with fresh mint leaves and additional pan-fried paneer cubes. Raita, dal fry, or dal tadka are excellent accompaniments."
