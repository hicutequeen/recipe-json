      "ingredients": [
        "2 cups boiled idli rice or short-grained rice, soaked for 4-5 hours",
        "1.5 cups rolled oats, soaked for 4-5 hours",
        "1/2 cup split black lentils (urad dal), soaked for 4-5 hours",
        "1/2 cup carrot, chopped into small cubes",
        "Water, as required for soaking and adjusting batter consistency",
        "Salt, to taste",
        "Oil, for frying uttapams"

      "directions": [
        "1. Wash the idli rice, rolled oats, and split black lentils thoroughly, then soak them in water for 4 to 5 hours or until they swell.",
        "2. Drain the excess water from the soaked ingredients and combine them in a blender. Blend until a smooth and soft batter is formed.",
        "3. If necessary, blend the ingredients in batches to avoid overloading the blender. Transfer the blended batter into a large mixing bowl.",
        "4. Cover the batter and allow it to ferment for 6 to 8 hours at room temperature, or longer if your environment is cool.",
        "5. Once fermented, set aside 1 cup of the batter. Add salt to the reserved batter, mixing well. Store the remaining batter in the refrigerator or freezer for later use.",
        "6. Heat a dosa tava or non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Grease the surface with a few drops of oil, wiping it with an onion or potato slice for even coating.",
        "7. When the pan is hot but not excessively so, pour a scoop of the batter into the center of the pan. Do not spread; instead, scatter the chopped carrot cubes over the batter.",
        "8. Drizzle a little oil over the carrot topping. Cover the pan with a lid to cook the top of the uttapam evenly without needing to flip it.",
        "9. Cook until the edges turn golden and crisp. Gently remove the uttapam with a spatula.",
        "10. Repeat the process with the remaining batter to cook additional uttapams.",
        "11. Serve the oats uttapams hot with coconut chutney and sambar."

        "1 cup boiled rice or idli rice, soaked",
        "\u00bd cup split black gram (urad dal), soaked",
        "1 cup quick-cooking oats, soaked",
        "Water as needed to adjust batter consistency",
        "1 teaspoon sugar",
        "Salt to taste",
        "Few drops of cooking oil for frying"

      "directions": [
        "Step 1: Soak the boiled rice, split black gram, and oats in sufficient water for 7-8 hours, or until they swell.",
        "Step 2: Drain the excess water and grind the mixture into a smooth batter, adding a little water as necessary to achieve a medium consistency.",
        "Step 3: Cover the batter and allow it to ferment for 7-8 hours or overnight in a warm place. The fermentation process may take longer in colder climates.",
        "Step 4: After fermentation, add salt and sugar to the batter, stirring gently to combine. If the batter is too thick, add a bit more water to achieve the desired consistency.",
        "Step 5: Heat a dosa pan over medium heat, and lightly grease it with a few drops of oil wiped on with a piece of halved onion or a cloth.",
        "Step 6: Pour a ladle of batter into the center of the pan and spread it in a circular motion towards the edges using a spatula or the back of a small bowl.",
        "Step 7: Drizzle a few drops of oil around the edges of the dosa. Once the bottom is golden brown, carefully flip and cook the other side.",
        "Step 8: Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat as necessary to avoid burning the dosas. Sprinkle water on the pan if temperatures rise too high.",
        "Step 9: Serve the oats dosa hot with coconut chutney or sambar."
