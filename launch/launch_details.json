        "Step 1: Prepare the Funfetti cake according to the recipe, splitting it into three layers. Level the cake layers and set aside to cool completely.",

Add the confectioners' sugar and beat on low speed until combined, then increase the speed to medium-high and beat for 3-4 minutes, until light and fluffy.",

Spread half of the peanut butter filling evenly over the cake layer. Top with a few tablespoons of your chosen jelly, spreading it over the peanut butter filling. Add the second cake layer and repeat with the remaining peanut butter filling and jelly. Top with the final cake layer.",

Pipe small swirls of frosting around the top edge of the cake and press a chocolate-covered potato chip into each swirl. Line the bottom edge of the cake with gummy bears, or decorate as desired.",
        "Step 8: Store: Cake is best eaten the day of assembly but will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days."
