        "200 grams sugar",
        "1 teaspoon cardamom powder",
        "200-210 grams besan (gram flour)",
        "125 grams desi ghee (clarified butter)",
        "6 green cardamoms, powdered (or 1 teaspoon pre-ground cardamom powder)",
        "5 almonds, sliced or chopped",
        "5 cashews, sliced or chopped",
        "1 tablespoon melon seeds (magaz, optional)",
        "Ghee for greasing the pan"

      "directions": [
        "Step 1: Prepare the pan. Grease a pan or tray generously with ghee. Alternatively, line the pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil and grease the lining.",
        "Step 2: Roast the besan. In a heavy-bottomed pan or kadai, melt 125g desi ghee over low heat. Add the besan in two batches, stirring continuously to prevent burning.",
        "Step 3: Continue roasting. Stir constantly until the besan absorbs the ghee, thickens, and forms a lump. Continue stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan to ensure even roasting.",
        "Step 4: Check for doneness. The besan is ready when it releases ghee, turns golden brown, and has a nutty aroma. This may take 15-20 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the cardamom powder.",
        "Step 5: Make the sugar syrup. In a separate saucepan, combine the sugar and \u00bd cup water. Cook over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.",
        "Step 6: Check syrup consistency. Continue boiling the syrup until it reaches a two-thread consistency. To test, drop a few drops of syrup onto a plate; let it cool slightly, then touch it with your finger. If it forms two thin threads, it's ready.",
        "Step 7: Combine syrup and besan. Quickly pour the hot sugar syrup into the roasted besan mixture and stir vigorously until well combined. The mixture will thicken rapidly.",
        "Step 8: Set the barfi. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and spread evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle the chopped almonds, cashews, and melon seeds over the top and press gently.",
        "Step 9: Cool and cut. Let the barfi cool and set until warm. Cut into squares or diamonds while still slightly warm.",
        "Step 10: Store. Store the besan barfi in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week."
