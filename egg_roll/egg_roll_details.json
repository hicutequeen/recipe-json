        "Step 2: Prepare the Sauces: In a small bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon water and 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Set aside. In another small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons water, oyster sauce, 2 teaspoons soy sauce, and sugar. Set aside.",
        "Step 3: Stir-fry the Chicken: Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken and stir-fry until it changes color and is 80% cooked. Remove the chicken from the wok and set aside.",
        "Step 4: Stir-fry the Vegetables: Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the wok. Add the minced garlic and stir-fry until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add the celery and onion, and stir-fry until the onion begins to brown. Add the bell pepper, mushrooms, and bean sprouts. Season with a pinch of salt and/or sugar, if desired. Stir in the green onions.",
        "Step 5: Combine and Thicken: Return the cooked chicken to the wok. Push the chicken and vegetables to the sides of the wok, creating a space in the center. Pour the oyster sauce mixture into the center. Give the cornstarch and water mixture a quick stir and add it to the oyster sauce mixture, stirring quickly to thicken the sauce. Mix everything together until well combined. Remove from heat and let cool.",
        "Step 6: Assemble the Egg Rolls: Lay an egg roll wrapper on a flat surface with one corner pointing towards you. Place 3 to 4 tablespoons of the filling in the center of the wrapper, leaving a border around the edges.  Mix 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water to create a sealing paste. Brush the edges of the wrapper with the cornstarch paste.",

Carefully add the egg rolls to the hot oil, a few at a time, and deep-fry until golden brown, about 3-5 minutes. Remove the egg rolls and drain on paper towels. Serve hot with sweet and sour sauce and/or hot mustard.",
