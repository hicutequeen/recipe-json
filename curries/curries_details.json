Alternatively, in a heavy-bottomed pan, bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink and has released its flavors and oils into the water. To save time, skip this step and add 4 cups of low-sodium chicken stock and raw chicken directly to the gravy in Step 3, cooking until the chicken is fully cooked.",

Finely chop the tomatoes separately. In the same pan, heat 2 tbsp of canola oil. Add the chopped onions and ginger-garlic mixture and fry until the onions are golden brown. Add all the dry spices (red pepper powder, red pepper flakes, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala) and fry for another minute. Add the chopped tomatoes and remaining salt, and fry until the oil separates from the mixture.",

Simmer over medium-high heat until the liquid has reduced by half (about 5-7 minutes). Add the cooked chicken (or raw chicken and stock if using the shortcut method) and continue cooking until the chicken is fully cooked and the gravy reaches your desired consistency. A pancake batter-like consistency is recommended, as the gravy will thicken as it sits.",
        "Step 4: Serving - Garnish with fresh cilantro (optional) and serve hot with your choice of flatbread."
