Maintain a rolling boil for 2 minutes, then turn off the heat but keep the saucepan covered for an additional 2 minutes.",

Remove from heat and let it cool. This syrup will thicken as it cools, providing approximately 80ml, enough for 2.5 servings. Store any leftover syrup in a jar in the fridge for up to one month. Mix the cooked boba with the syrup until well-coated; do not refrigerate or they will harden.",
        "Step 6: To assemble the bubble tea, fill a 485ml drinking glass (or two smaller glasses) with the sweetened boba. Pour in the brewed tea and add 1 tablespoon of clear sugar syrup. Mix gently to combine while preserving the marble effect along the sides of the glass.",
        "Step 7: Top the glass with 200ml of milk and serve with a boba straw. Enjoy the bubble tea either hot or cold based on your preference."
